Paste crawler
=============

A paste crawler that scrapes the websites, and stores it in a CouchDB
structure.

You can get up and running fast with docker, if you dont care much for
security.

On a docker host, just run the following:
```docker run klaemo/couchdb:latest```

Change the configuration file with the specific ip address, and you are up and
running.
